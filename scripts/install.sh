# folder so any Muse user can invoke the skills by name.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/install.sh [DEST]
#
# DEST defaults to ~/workspace/custom-skills when that folder exists
# (the Muse workspace layout), otherwise to ~/.muse/skills. Pass an
# explicit folder to install anywhere else. Existing redmuse skills
# in DEST are replaced. Nothing else in DEST is touched.
